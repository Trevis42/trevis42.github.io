## Testing gh pages

This repos is to test github pages [located here.](https://trevis42.github.io "Test github pages site")

In the **gh-pages** branch there are several files:
- index.md
  - this is the main index file that will be served up **(can also name it index.html... also README.md will work if neither are present)
- slideshow.html
  - this one has a markdown slideshow that can buit out. pressinc _'C'_ will allow for cloneing the presentation, then hitting _'P'_ will enter 
    presentermode.
- \_config.yml
  - this one is the config file for the jeykl theme. You can add title and description here as well.
- README.md
  - this one is currently being used as standard readme instead of main page that is turned into `index.html` by github pages.
  
__I hope this helps you understand more aboue the site__
