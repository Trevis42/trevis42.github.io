## Intro
**About me...** I have been interested in _technology_ for many years.

Over the years I continued to learn and study, hoping to grow my knowledge and understanding of techology to one day better the world around me. I started this curiosity with my love of Lego sets and what I could build with them. I decided to pursue engineering in college to put that curiosity and creativity to use. While studing Mechanical Engineering, I found it not as fulfiling as I had hoped. I switched to Computer Engineering a year later. I enjoyed learning the Electrical Engineering side of that major but found a true passion for Computer Science.

I then tried my hand at game design programming because it interested me and allowed me to develop programming skills. I started that learning at Lone Star College - Kingwood. 
The instructors were great but I found my self enjoying the programming side of that more than the game design side. This lead me to focus on programming and get a degree I could utilize in nearly any aspect of my career -- a Computer Science degree from SHSU.

*[SHSU]: Sam Houston State University

Programming and designing various code projects made me happy, helped me enjoy school, and inspired me to complete the degree as soon as possible. 
I had some really interesting course lessons and projects that pushed my intellect and learning. The instructors encouraged us to learn on our own with the information they provided. I learned some really unique, fun ways to solve problems and help others learn how to solve those problems as
well.

I continue to learn new technology and skills on my own. I strive to apply this knowledge to solve challenges that come my way and implement it into each new project I work on.
