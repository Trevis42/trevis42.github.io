### MOST RELEVANT PROJECTS/WORK:

#### The Virtual N.O.M.

This project helps users find a place to eat nearby, filtered by selected preferences. Non-filtered preferences will default search radius to 5 miles. We use Yelp API for obtaining our data and store the searches in a database to minimize calls to the API sever, allowing for faster queries and filtering during a session (especially when location does not change but distance does). This image shows sample data from a document in the database.
