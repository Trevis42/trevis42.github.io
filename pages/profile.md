## Intro
**About me...** I have been interested in _technology_ for many years.

Over the years I continued to learn and study, hoping to grow in the knowledge to one day better
the world around me. I started this curiosity with my love of Lego sets and what I could build
with them. I was determined to be an engineer in college to my hands on learning and creating.
When I did go into Mechanical Engineering, I found it not as fun and creative as I had hoped
for. I switched to Computer Engineering a year later. I enjoyed learn the Electrical Engineering
side of that major but I was really excited and focus more on the Computer Science side.

That led me to want to pursue game design. I started that learning at Lone Star College -
Kingwood. They have an amazing Game Design programming focus associate degree path. The
instructors where great but I found my self enjoying the programming side of that more than the
design side. This lead me to focus on programming and get a degree I could utilize in nearly any
place I would be working -- a Computer Science degree from SHSU.

*[SHSU]: Sam Houston State University

Programming and designing various code projects is something that makes made me happy and helped
encouraged me enjoy school and push to complete the degree as soon as possible. I had some
really interesting course lessons and projects that pushed my intellect and learning. The
instructors encouraged us to learn on our own with the information they provided. I learned some
really unique, fun ways to solve problems and help others learn how to solve those problems as
well.
